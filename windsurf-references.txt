1) SCHIZODOT AI — PROJECT REFERENCE FOR WINDSURF
OVERVIEW

Project Context:
SchizoDot AI is developed for a mental health hackathon aiming to showcase a fully functional end-to-end AI system that connects patient data capture, AI-driven analysis, and clinician insights in real-time. The goal is a working prototype, not a polished product — focus on clarity, robustness, and explainability.

a. PROJECT VISION

SchizoDot AI is a mental health support system designed for schizophrenia therapy monitoring using multimodal AI — combining visual, audio, and textual analysis.
The aim is to assist clinicians by tracking patient engagement, mood, and medication adherence (pill ingestion).

The system enables:

Patients to submit short daily video/audio recordings via a mobile app (built using Lovable frontend).

AI models to analyze these submissions for emotional tone, facial expressions, and speech features.

Clinicians to view insights through a dashboard and monitor patient trends in real time.

This project’s focus during the hackathon is to:

Deliver a fully functional backend + infrastructure pipeline that demonstrates the full data flow — from media upload to AI inference and clinical data storage — while keeping the frontend simple but integrated.

b. HIGH-LEVEL SYSTEM FLOW

Patient records and uploads an audio or video file from the frontend.

Frontend requests a presigned S3 URL from the backend.

File uploads directly to AWS S3.

Backend receives a confirmation and logs the file info in DynamoDB.

A background worker triggers AI model pipelines for analysis:

Object detection → Verify pill ingestion.

Speech emotion recognition → Detect tone, mood, stress.

LLM analysis → Interpret behavior, summarize clinical insights.

The results are stored back in DynamoDB.

Clinician dashboard fetches and visualizes data.

c. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
FRONTEND (Lovable)

Developed using Lovable.dev (no-code React/Next.js builder).

Focused on patient upload page and clinician result dashboard.

Communicates via API calls to FastAPI backend.

Simple and fast: handles file uploads, results viewing, and notifications.

BACKEND (FastAPI)

Core logic, API routing, and integration hub.

Handles:

S3 presigned URL generation

File confirmation logging (DynamoDB)

AI analysis job creation (trigger Bedrock or local models)

Built with:

FastAPI for async web APIs

Pydantic for schema validation

Uvicorn + Gunicorn for serving

Celery or async tasks for background analysis

INFRASTRUCTURE (AWS + Docker)

AWS EC2 runs everything using Docker Compose.

Nginx acts as reverse proxy.

Docker Containers:

fastapi-main: Main API server

ai-pipeline: Object detection & emotion recognition models

worker: Multimodal fusion and LLM processing

AWS Services:

S3 → Media storage

DynamoDB → Metadata + analysis logs

Bedrock → Foundation models (LLM reasoning)

Transcribe (future) → Speech-to-text

CloudWatch → Monitoring and logging

d. WINDSURF’S ROLE IN THIS HACKATHON

Windsurf acts as the infrastructure engineer + backend developer + AI pipeline integrator.
Your responsibilities include orchestrating all backend logic and ensuring the system runs end-to-end.

Your primary roles:

Infra Builder

Set up Docker architecture (FastAPI, AI models, worker, Nginx).

Manage environment variables and secrets safely.

Configure AWS CLI and credentials.

Ensure all services run under Docker network with smooth internal communication.

Backend Developer

Maintain and extend FastAPI endpoints:

/presign → Request S3 upload URL

/confirm → Log file details

/analyze → Trigger AI analysis pipeline

Ensure clean structure, validation, and error handling.

Integrate Bedrock SDK and AI service calls.

AI Integration Developer

Link inference modules (object detection, emotion recognition, LLM).

Build modular AI pipeline:

Load models via PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Process uploaded file (via S3 download).

Output structured JSON back to DynamoDB.

Design “multimodal fusion” — combine multiple AI outputs (face, speech, LLM text).

Pipeline Automator

Implement background tasks (Celery / Async / Thread workers).

Enable job queue for processing uploads asynchronously.

Manage logging and error reporting.

System Monitor

Use CloudWatch or local logs for debugging.

Track performance and scalability.

Ensure system stability for multiple concurrent uploads.

e. AI COMPONENTS AND WHAT THEY DO

- Object Detection — Pill Intake Verification

Uses a pretrained CNN model (e.g., YOLOv8 or custom PyTorch model).

Detects “pill,” “hand,” and “face” in video frames.

Verifies pill ingestion sequence by analyzing temporal patterns.

Note that this will be developed by other developers, our job is to ensure the integration is smooth.

- Speech Emotion Recognition

Extracts features using Librosa or pyAudioAnalysis.

Predicts emotional state (e.g., calm, anxious, agitated).

Model could be lightweight CNN or GRU for quick inference.

Note that this will be developed by other developers, our job is to ensure the integration is smooth.

- Multimodal Fusion + LLM Analysis

Fuses results from object + emotion modules into a unified “patient insight.”

Uses AWS Bedrock (Claude / Titan / Mistral models) for:

Natural language summarization (“The patient appears compliant and calm.”)

Behavioral trend prediction.

Generating clinician-friendly insights.

f. FRONTEND CONNECTION (Lovable Integration)

Frontend is built using Lovable.dev, which generates React/Next.js applications with minimal configuration.
Windsurf only needs to expose APIs properly — Lovable will handle:

Calling backend endpoints.

Handling file upload via presigned S3 URL.

Displaying upload status and results from DynamoDB.

Endpoints expected:

POST /api/v1/presign → Generate presigned URL

POST /api/v1/confirm → Log file

POST /api/v1/analyze → Trigger AI pipeline

GET /api/v1/results/{patient_id} → Retrieve analysis

2) CURRENT PROGRESS

The FastAPI backend is fully functional with local testing.

AWS S3 and DynamoDB are configured in us-east-1.

The IAM user schizodot-dev has limited access for S3 and DynamoDB.

Local environment uses Python virtual environment and Docker for backend.

CORS configuration on S3 is working correctly.

The full pipeline from upload → confirm → DynamoDB is verified.

3) NEXT GOALS FOR WINDSURF

Windsurf’s task is to take over the entire project development and integration.
It must ensure all components are stable, scalable, and properly documented.

Key responsibilities:

a. Backend stabilization

Maintain FastAPI backend with clean structure, error handling, and secure config.

Manage AWS connections (S3, DynamoDB, Bedrock).

Add structured logging and environment configuration.

c. AWS integration

Ensure correct regions (us-east-1).

Manage S3 for media storage and DynamoDB for logs.

Use Bedrock (or mock service) for AI analysis.

Apply least-privilege IAM policies.

d. Containerization and deployment

Use Docker and docker-compose for development.

Prepare an EC2 deployment plan using Nginx reverse proxy and Docker containers.

e. Background worker setup

Prepare a worker container for heavy tasks (e.g., model inference, transcription).

Use Redis or another queue for task management.

f. Bedrock integration

Connect Bedrock for text and audio analysis.

Store AI-generated insights back into DynamoDB.

g. Documentation and CI/CD

Maintain clear README and .env.example.

Add testing and CI workflows.

Document all setup and verification steps.

h. Development Priorities for Hackathon Phase:

- Get the full backend flow working (upload → confirm → log → analyze).

- Connect Bedrock mock to simulate AI inference.

- Expose clean API endpoints for Lovable frontend.

- Add background processing for AI jobs.

- Deploy to EC2 with Docker and Nginx.

📘 Document every tested step and component.

11) SUMMARY: WINDSURF’S MISSION

Windsurf should:

Be the backend and infra brain of SchizoDot AI.

Keep all components connected and consistent with AWS best practices.

Build in a modular, documented, and production-ready manner.

Understand that AI = multiple models + fusion + reasoning — not just LLMs.

Maintain developer clarity so future contributors can extend easily.

Deliver an end-to-end demo for the hackathon that visually proves the data and AI flow.
